/**
 * 	In ZK world, a Composer [1] plays the same role as the Controller and you can assign it to a target
 *  component. Through the composer, you can listen events of the target component and manipulate 
 *  target component's child components to change View's presentation according to your requirement.
 *  To create a Controller in ZK you simply	create a class that inherits SelectorComposer [2].
